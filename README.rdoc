= RSpreedly

Ruby library to access the Spreedly API (all of it).

== Why another one?

There are a few of these knocking about, but I couldn't find one particular to my needs:

 * Well covered with specs - currently 100% coverage
 * Covers the entire API, not just parts of it
 * Rubyish/ActiveRecord style access

== Installation

It's on Gemcutter, so as long as you're setup to use that:

    gem install rspreedly
    
Otherwise

    gem install gemcutter
    gem tumble
    gem install rspreedly

== Usage

Configure your API key and site name for your account:

    RSpreedly::Config.setup do |config|
      config.api_key        = "your-api-key"
      config.site_name      = "your-site-name"
    end

List subscribers

    RSpreedly::Subscriber.find(:all).each do |subscriber|
      # do something
    end

CRUD access to subscribers

    sub = RSpreedly::Subscriber.new(:customer_id => 42, :email => "somewhere@example.com")
    sub.token => nil
    sub.save 
    sub.token => "6af9994a57e420345897b1abb4c27a9db27fa4d0"
        
    sub = RSpreedly::Subscriber.find(42)
    sub.email = "new-email@example.com"
    sub.save
    
    sub = RSpreedly::Subscriber.find(69)
    sub.destroy

Comp subscriptions

    comp = RSpreedly::ComplimentarySubscription.new(:duration_quantity => 3, :duration_units => "months", :feature_level => "Pro")      
    sub = RSpreedly::Subscriber.find(69)
    sub.comp_subscription(comp)

View all plans

    plans = RSpreedly::SubscriptionPlan.find(:all)
    
Raise an invoice, and pay it

    invoice = RSpreedly::Invoice.new(:subscription_plan_id => 5, :subscriber => sub)
    invoice.save
    
    payment = RSpreedly::PaymentMethod::CreditCard.new(:card_type => 'visa', :number => '123456', ...)
    invoice.pay(payment)

Error messages
  
    invoice = RSpreedly::Invoice.new
    invoice.save => false
    invoice.errors => ["You must specify both the subscription plan id and subscriber information."]

See the specs and API docs at Spreedly for more details and the rest of the things it can do.

== Todo

 * Better specs for data we send to Spreedly.
 * Better docs.

== Thanks

I studied the other Spreedly APIs and there may well be a line or three this library has in common with:

 * http://github.com/terralien/spreedly-gem
